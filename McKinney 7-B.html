   <h1>Is Coconut Cult Worth It?</h1>

    <p>In order for the probiotics to work, they need to be alive. Probiotics come alive through prebiotics, like food. Coconut Cult can help with bloating, inflammation, digestion, immunity, and overall health. </p>

    <p>It is recommended to eat the coconut yogurt first thing in the morning with breakfast or as an after dinner snack. Since the yogurt is so concentrated, it is recommended to eat only a tablespoon a day.</p>
